          <h3>Get to know me.</h3>
          <div class="about--para">
              <p>Since I was young I always showed an interest in electronics and technology. Always opening up game consoles to try and figure out how they tick</p>
              <p>As I grew older I gained another interest - IT, I would spend hours upon hours in front of a computer reading and learing about new en emerging tech in the market</p>
              <p>After matric I completed a course and received a Microsoft Certified IT Professional certification however due to unforeseen events was never able to get my foot inside the IT door.</p>
              <p>I did not give up on the dream though, always trying to learn something new whenever I get the chance between work and other personal responsibilities.</p>
              <p>I taught myself the fundamentals of web development but quickly realized in order for my new passion to flourish and turn into a career I had to exit my comfort zone and study again for a qualification</p>
              <p>Fastforward a few years and here we are, on the road to achieving a dream!</p>

          <h3>My hobbies</h3>
          <div class="about--para">
            <p>One of my primary fascinations lies in coding, where I find joy wracking my brain to find solutions to complex problems.</p>
            <p>The process of programming allows me to express my creativity while simultaneously nurturing my logical thinking skills.</p>
            <p>It's incredibly satisfying to witness lines of code transform into functional and efficient software applications or beautiful websites.</p>
            <p>There is great joy once you have finished, looking at your code and work, and feeling a sense of accomplishment, knowing that I made this.</p>

            <p>I am an avid enthusiast of video games. I enjoy playing immersive RPG's with expansiv worlds and captivating narratives.</p>
            <p>Whether it's embarking on thrilling adventures, gathering herbs, or unraveling intricate puzzles, video games provide me with a delightful escape and an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals in the gaming community</p>

            <p>Another profound interest of mine is music. The power of melodies, rhythms, and lyrics to evoke emotions and convey stories resonates deeply with me.</p>
            <p>I am constantly exploring various genres, from obscure songs featuring a hurdy-gurdy, spine-chilling metal, late night drum n bass, to contemporary tunes, there is no limit to what one can experience from music around the world, allowing me to appreciate the rich tapestry of musical expression</p>

            <p>And lastly, when there is enough time in the day, I will listen to audiobooks, such as the Kingkiller Chronicles, The Stormlight Archives and Dune.</p>

          <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
              <p>Once I have completed this course I will registered for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year. Once I have completed the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, I want to expand my knowledge about Web Development and learn about React.js.
                  React.js is a very popular and in demand JavaScript library. I want to learn all there is to know it, and thereafter learn about React Native</p>
              <p>Once I have completed those goals I will learn how to code with Electron.js. With all of these JavaScript frameworks I will be fully equipped to create Web, Mobile and Desktop applications. With hopefully enough experience to land a front-end developer job.</p>
              <p>Thereafter I will endeavour learning deeply about the back-end environment in development.</p>
